# Galvanize Case Studies
A collection of data science case studies

## [Fraud Detection](https://github.com/aworth00/Galvanize_Case_Studies/tree/master/fraud-detection-case-study)
Goal: To capture, store, and predict fraud being sampled from a heroku server. 

Accomplished: Implemented a pickled random forest classifier in an AWS hosted flask app that would be accesible by or clients. Our app would capture, predict, and store the customer with their associated fraud in a MongoDB.
